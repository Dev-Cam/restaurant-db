# The Useless Useful Recipe Site

A completely useless website of recipes that may give you a laugh. Create, edit and comment on recipes all from the security of being behind a screen. 

Play nicely though, there are no idiot sandwiches here.

Find it here https://useless-useful-recipes.herokuapp.com/

Tech stack: Ruby on Rails, CSS

Wish list:
1. A profile page button in the nav for users to easily access their profile
2. like button on the recipe 
3. ratings in the comments
